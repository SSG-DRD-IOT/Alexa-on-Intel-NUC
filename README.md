In the Documents folder you will also find two PDFs: 

"Getting Started With Intel NUC and AWS" covers basic getting started instructions and teaches you how to use Node-RED to send sensor data to AWS - Start here to learn how to connect to your device 


"Alexa Voice Service on Intel NUC" covers how to use the code in this repository to create the Alexa Voice Service integration with the Intel NUC.

To connect to the Gateway using the broadcast SSID connect your host computer to the SSID displayed on the front of the Gateway (IDPDK-XXXX) and use the password "windriveridp". You will then be able to ssh to root@192.168.1.1 with passwor root. If the Gateway is plugged into ethernet you will still be able to browse the web on your host computer as well.
